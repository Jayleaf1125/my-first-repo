# my-first-repo

Good morning/afternoon/evening, my name is Jason Padilla. In github, I go by Jayleaf1125.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer; and eventually transfer into VR and AR development.
For those who don't know, VR stands for "Virtual Reality" and AR stands for "Augmented Reality".
